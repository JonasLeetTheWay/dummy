Hey there, I've started coding since January 2022.
These projects showcase my journey.
Currently a Mechanical Engineering student, who fluents in Python and Java languages.

I decide to jump into the field of computer vision, after taking huge interest in some of the computer vision related courses. I have been trying to transfer some of my Matlab projects into Python framework.

Let us enjoy some of the projects I've made!
